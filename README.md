The repo is designed to enable me to explore the a platform that I was previously unfamiliar with.

It first greets the user and promps them to enter their name. It then echos their name back to them and asks them if they are traveling to a random planet. Depending on their response, either a random planet or a planet selected by the user and prints its name and description.
